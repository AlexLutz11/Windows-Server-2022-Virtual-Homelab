# Windows-Server-2022-Virtual-Homelab

This lab demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine for homelab experimentation. The lab focuses on building a functional internal network using VirtualBox, with services including:

Active Directory (AD DS)
DNS Server
DHCP Server

The server is configured to communicate with an Ubuntu client VM over an isolated internal network. The goal is to simulate a real-world domain environment for learning and testing purposes.
